# üîñ Version Control, Template Testing, & Review Workflows for CloudFormation

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Version Control for Templates**

* **Store templates in Git** (or any VCS):

  * Track changes, rollback, and collaborate easily.
  * Enables code reviews and audit trails.
* **Recommended structure:**

  ```
  /cloudformation
    /network
      vpc.yaml
    /app
      webapp.yaml
    /modules
      s3-bucket.yaml
  ```
* **Tag and branch** for releases and environment-specific versions (e.g., `main`, `dev`, `feature/*`).

---

## üß™ **Template Testing Tools**

### 1. **cfn-lint**

* **Purpose:** Checks YAML/JSON CloudFormation templates for syntax errors, best practices, and some resource-level errors.
* **Usage:**

  ```sh
  cfn-lint template.yaml
  ```
* **Real-world use:**
  Catch mistakes (wrong properties, typos) before deploying, reducing failed stacks.

### 2. **taskcat**

* **Purpose:** Open-source tool for automated testing of CloudFormation templates by deploying them into real AWS accounts.
* **Usage:**

  * Define test scenarios and parameters in `.taskcat.yml`.
  * Run tests and validate actual stack creation/teardown.
  * Sample config:

    ```yaml
    project:
      name: my-cloudformation-tests
    tests:
      default:
        template: ./webapp.yaml
        regions:
          - us-east-1
        parameters:
          InstanceType: t3.micro
    ```
  * Run:

    ```sh
    taskcat test run
    ```
* **Real-world use:**
  CI systems use taskcat to catch integration issues that linting can‚Äôt detect (like missing IAM permissions or dependency problems).

## üîé **Review Workflows**

* **Pull Requests (PRs):**

  * All changes go through PRs for peer review.
  * Enforce template validation (`cfn-lint`), tests (`taskcat`), and automated checks before merging.
* **Automated CI/CD Pipelines:**

  * On PR/merge, trigger validation and test jobs.
  * Example using GitHub Actions:

    ```yaml
    - name: Lint templates
      run: cfn-lint '**/*.yaml'
    - name: Test templates
      run: taskcat test run
    ```
* **Approval Gates:**

  * Require manual approval for production deploys.
  * Document reviews for compliance and audits.

---

## üöÄ **Best Practices**

* Treat infrastructure as code‚Äîeverything in Git.
* Automate testing and validation on every change.
* Always require code review before deployment.
* Use branches for safe experimentation and environment separation.
* Document any manual steps in README files.
